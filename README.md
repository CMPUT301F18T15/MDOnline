CMPUT301 F18 T15 project

Our app allows for patients to record any medical problems they have on their body. Patients will also have a Care Provider that will be able to view their records/problems to better assist them at any given moment of the day. A patient can choose to record could be an image, geolocation, bodylocation, description, date and many more attributes. This allows for a very in depth descriptions of their record which their Care Provider can look over. The app will also also remind patients to continually report their records on a time basis, ensuring that the Care Provider has consistent and frequent updates.

We follow these principles:
```
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

Welcome changing requirements, even late in 
development. Agile processes harness change for 
the customer's competitive advantage.

Deliver working software frequently, from a 
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
preference to the shorter timescale.

Business people and developers must work 
together daily throughout the project.

Build projects around motivated individuals. 
Give them the environment and support they need, 
and trust them to get the job done.

The most efficient and effective method of 
conveying information to and within a development 
team is face-to-face conversation.

Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Agile processes promote sustainable development. 
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

Continuous attention to technical excellence 
and good design enhances agility.

Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount 
of work not done--is essential.

The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
emerge from self-organizing teams.

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
its behavior accordingly.
