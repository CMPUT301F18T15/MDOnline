CMPUT301 F18 T15 project

Our app allows for patients to record any medical problems they have on their body. Patients will also have a Care Provider that will be able to view their records/problems to better assist them at any given moment of the day. A patient can choose to record could be an image, geolocation, bodylocation, description, date and many more attributes. This allows for a very in depth descriptions of their record which their Care Provider can look over. The app will also also remind patients to continually report their records on a time basis, ensuring that the Care Provider has consistent and frequent updates.
